<div align="center"><h1>Giulio Venturini</h1></div>

I'm interested in anything CS related and I have a special interest for retrocomputing.
In this account you can find both modern projects and retrocomputing projects.

I have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa5Pyv9BX-S22ac6Y3bxm3g) where I post some retrocomputing stuff that I've done.
